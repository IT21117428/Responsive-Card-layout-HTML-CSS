# Responsive-Card-layout-HTML-CSS

This project demonstrates a simple and responsive card UI layout, built using HTML and CSS. Each card contains an image, heading, description, and a link. The layout is flexible, ensuring that the cards align properly within their container and have hover effects for improved interactivity.

## Features

- **Responsive Card Layout**: Displays a grid of cards, each containing an image, a title, a brief description, and a link.
- **Hover Effects**: The cards have a smooth box-shadow transition on hover for better user interaction.
- **Modern and Clean UI**: Styled using minimalistic colors and a clean design with proper padding, spacing, and rounded corners.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the card layout and content.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the cards, hover effects, and responsive grid.
- **CSS Reset**: Used to remove default browser styles and ensure consistency across different browsers.
